There’s a variety of ways you can use videos to improve the quality of your website’s content. Depending on the type of the site you’re running, you can display entertaining videos, tutorials, music videos or news publications. No matter what kinds of content you choose to display, YouTube Gallery by Elfsight is one of the most obvious choices. We’re proud to offer you a plugin that is both functional and stylish, a plugin that will equally delight users with different goals and purposes. 

The rich functionality of the Elfsight YouTube channel plugin doesn’t make it complicated or hard to use. In fact, the set up process is so simple, that anyone can do it in a blink of an eye!

For your greater convenience, all the settings are logically divided into four tabs. The tab you’ll most likely start with is called Sources. That’s where you set the sources for your amazing gallery. And the greatest thing is that the only thing you need to do to create the gallery of your dreams is copy a YouTube URL and paste it into the Sources field. You can make your YouTube channel stand out on your site, by pasting its URL into the YouTube Channel URL field, or you can make the videos blend in with the rest of the content, by creating Source Groups and pasting the URLs into the Source field of each Source Group.

The next tab is the Layout tab. Here you can set your gallery’s appearance and behavior. The very first thing you can set up is the YouTube channel size. Just set the width of the gallery in pixels, and you will see it change its size right away.

Configuring your gallery’s header is also very exciting. You can choose one of the three design modes – classic, accent or minimal. Channel name, number of subscribers, videos, views and more – if you need, you can display all this in your channel’s header. One of the more exciting features, however, is the option of setting your custom channel name, description and banner. 

One of the more important tabs in the Layout section is Content. That’s where you set your gallery’s greed – the number of columns and rows, the controls that you’re going to use, and the direction of the gallery scroll. 

On the Video tab you can configure the appearance of video thumbnails by choosing the information you need to display on them. Also, you have three choices of video play modes. 

On the Colors tab you can color the gallery in any way you like. You can either choose one of the 5 predefined color schemes, or set your own colors for each element of the gallery. 

Others tab is the place where you can set the cache time, select your language and enable AdSense. 

And in case you should have any questions, our friendly Support Team is always there for you! Just message us at apps@elfsight.com and we’ll be happy to help in every way we can!
